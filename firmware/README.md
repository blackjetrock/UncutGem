# Firmware

An ESP32 development board is used as both controller for the ADF4351 signal generator and as an Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC) to read the signal from the photodiode amplifier.

The firmware is included in the [`src`](./src/) directory. 

## Some Considerations in Firmware

There were many considerations made to improve the accessibility and reliability of the sensor's operation.

### Arduino IDE

The Arduino IDE is a very forgiving generic development environment for microcontrollers. It is aimed primarily at hobbyists, but has gained traction as a very easy way to 'fast prototype' microcontroller application designs. 

We make use of it in this project so that as many people as possible can make use of the code on as many platforms as necessary. Rather than writing specific SPI handling code for the ADF4350, we instead can just make calls to `spi->transfer(data[i]);` from a generic SPI code API that is then ported to devices individually. Although there are many things in this code that are specifically coded for the ESP32 (such as pin definitions) these are all easily changeable to make the code work on other microcontrollers, based on availability. 

### Hard Coding ADF4350 Freq Values

The PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) interface on the ADF4350 derives its output frequency from several settings, each of which as to be calculated carefully before sending to the device. 

However, calculating these values on the fly from a given frequency input has two major drawbacks:

1. Time - the computation can be slow, especially on older microcontrollers.
2. Noise - calculating the correct values can generate more noise from the microcontroller during operation.

Regarding time, the reason things slow down is due to the fact that some microcontrollers have to do a lot of work to parse large numbers (in the billions for GHz). So pre-computing saves a lot of time, at the expense of a relatively small amount of memory - ~30bytes for each frequency. 

Regarding noise - the measurements we are looking for are very small, so a lot of amplification is in place to find them. If the microcontroller's power draw is screaming in the background, then it results in a very messy signal. However loading bytes in/out of memory and out over SPI is relatively quiet. As such, rather than doing side-channel amplification on our microcontroller, we instead can get at  the signal from the diamond.
