# UNCUT GEMS - Build Guide

This is as comprehensive build guide as we can make for the UNCUT GEMS open source NV center diamond sensor!

Things we don't cover:

- How to solder - lots of help out there for that!
- How to have a PCB manufactured - but we do provide files that should be compatible with most manufacturers, e.g. JLCPCB, PCBWay, etc.
- TODO - more?
