# Uncut Gem
A prototype Full Stack fully Open Source NV Center Diamond Magnetometer

There are several sections detailing the parts of the build: 

- [`/science`](./science) - a folder with an explaination and references for the science behind the sensor. 
- [`/firmware`](./firmware/) - details the firmware used in the sensor.
- [`hardware`](./hardware/) - has two main sections
  - [`hardware/pcb`](./hardware/PCB/) - details the PCB schematics and parts
  - [`hardware/DiamondMount`](./hardware/DiamondMount/) - details how the diamond is mounted
- [Build Guide](./BuildGuide/BuildGuide.md) - a comprehensive build guide for the sensor.
