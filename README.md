A prototype Full Stack fully Open Source NV Center Diamond Magnetometer

There are several sections detailing the parts of the build: 

- [`/science`](./science) - a folder with an explaination and references for the science behind the sensor. 
- [`/firmware`](./firmware/) - details the firmware used in the sensor.
- [`hardware`](./hardware/) - has two main sections
  - [`hardware/pcb`](./hardware/PCB/) - details the PCB schematics and parts
  - [`hardware/DiamondMount`](./hardware/DiamondMount/) - details how the diamond is mounted
- [Build Guide](./BuildGuide/BuildGuide.md) - a comprehensive build guide for the sensor.

## Project Mission

We are creating the world's first fully open-source quantum sensing platform designed from the start to be accessible, future-proof, and mostimportantly; hackable! 

We are designing, building, provisioning, and aiming for distribution of a fully open hardware platform, complete with fully open firmware, that gives a firm basis for anyone to start learning about quantum sensing through nitrogen vacancy center diamond magnetometry. 

By incorporating key design decisions, we are buildling the basis for what we think will be quantum technology's 'Apple II moment'; the opportunity for anyone who is curious to gain access to a quantum device that they can operate safely at home, with the full capability to customize, improve, develop with, and share knowledge about this incredible technology. 

## Cost per Device

The ballpark costs are as follows (in GBP):

| Item                   | Number | Cost      |

| OpAmp + electronics    | 1      | up to £5  |
| Laser Module           | 1      | ~£5-15    |
| ADF4350/1 MW Generator | 1      | £15-25    |
| MW Gain (40dB) + BNC   | 1      | £10       |
| PCB (unit from run)    | 1      | ~£5       |
| OLED Screen            | 1      | £5        |
| ESP32 board            | 1      | ~£10      |
| NV Center Diamond      | 1      | ~£10      |
| Epoxy and Cu Wire      | 1 ea.  | £10-15    |
|                        | **TOTAL** | ~£115  |
